# Classification of Consumer Complaints

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau publishes the Consumer Complaint Database, a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that were sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. 

You have been provided with a dataset of over 900,000 such complaints for the 25 most common issue types. Your goal is to train a text classification model to identify the issue type based on the consumer complaint narrative. The data can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gW6LScUL-Z7mH6gUZn-1aNzm4p4CvtpL/view?usp=share_link 

At the end of the project, your team should should prepare a short presentation where you talk about the following:
* What steps did you take to preprocess the data?
* What did you find based on your exploratory analysis?
* What models did you try and how successful were they? Where did they struggle? Were there issues that the models commonly mixed up?
